	* all: Synch with latest lwip CVS  and a bunch of other updates
	
2002-06-21  Jani Monoses <jani@iv.ro>
	* all:sync with/tweak lwIP from lwIP-CVS snapshot 29-05-2002 (no more memory reclaims,
	reorganized ARP/ethernet layer,TCP modifications...)
	* put the package under net/ where the other two *BSD stacks are and 
	* ecosif.c:modified to use new etharp code.
	
2002-05-17  Jani Monoses <jani@iv.ro>

	* tcpip.c:bugfix from lwIP CVS in addition to the ones locally corrected
	during the past few weeks
	* lwip.cdl:saner(greater) default for TCP related values
	
2002-04-24  Jani Monoses <jani@iv.ro>

	* sys_arch.c: replace fix_mempool with allocation 'by hand'
	for thread stacks to not worry about allocator overhead and 
	it's simpler too.
	
2002-04-23  Jani Monoses <jani@iv.ro>

	* lwip.cdl,sys_arch.c : memory usage for thread stacks and others
	configurable
	* sys_arch.c: "stupid bug of the month" - use parantheses in macro
	tick_to_ms().Without this semaphore wait could falsely return 0
	every 10 minutes or so meaning 'not taken' which would lead to
	deadlock.
	
2002-04-17  Jani Monoses <jani@iv.ro>

	* bugfixes in sys_arch.c: if no memory is available return NULL
	semaphore and mbox (use cyg_mempool_var_try_alloc() instead of blocking
	version as this prevents DoS attacks when memory is full).Free the
	allocated memory too after semaphore and mbox destruction.

	* more CDL work:IP addresses now settable,statistics gathering
	 selection
	 
2002-04-12  Jani Monoses <jani@iv.ro>,Cristian Vlasin <cris@iv.ro>	

	* tests/	: add test cases 
	* cdl/lwip.cdl  : verbosity options and some other configuration
	* bugfix in sys_arch.c : sys_arch_mbox_fetch should check for NULL data
	* changed package name to CYGPKG_NET_LWIP

2002-04-05  Jani Monoses <jani@iv.ro>	

	* First version.Contains a somewhat reorganized lwIP-0.5.3 tree,
